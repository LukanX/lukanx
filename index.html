      <h2>Who this guy?</h2>
      <p>Howdy! My name is Lance and I'm a user experience researcher. What does that mean exactly? It means I'm into usability and ethnography. My interests in UX don't just stop there though: I'm into coding as well, and I'm trying to get more into the design aspect of UX.</p>
      <p>But just talking about work is boring. When I'm not doing any of that stuff, I'm also into videogames, brewing (and drinking) beers, biking, and writing. I try to maintain a dry wit, and enjoy puns and pop culture.</p>
      
      <h2>What's this site for?</h2>
      <p>Like most personal websites, vanity mostly. Besides apeasing my own ego, it's a place to organize and collect my thoughts and projects. It also lets me add an extra line of text to my business cards.</p>
